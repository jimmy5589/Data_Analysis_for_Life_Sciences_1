0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
 

1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,300
SPEAKER: All right.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,330
In this video, we&#39;re going to show how the central limit

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,910
theorem is used in conjunction with t-statistics to obtain p-values.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,630
And later we&#39;ll see how they&#39;re used to construct confidence intervals as well.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,312
So we&#39;re going to use the mouse example where we constructed

6
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,520
a difference in mean already.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,090
What we&#39;re going to do now is construct the t-statistics.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,700
For that we need to estimate the standard error.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:36,230
And we do that by taking the square root of the variance of the sample estimate

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,060
of the variance-- it&#39;s not variance.

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,460
It&#39;s far-- divided by n, where n is the sample size.

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,280
That&#39;s up here.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,060
And the we add variance of the control.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,800
 

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,680
And that gives us an error estimate.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,770
And we can form a t-statistic by simply dividing the observed difference

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,295
by its estimated standard deviation.

18
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:06,911
 

19
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:07,410
OK?

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,570
There we go.

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,700
Now, what&#39;s really useful about central limit theorem

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,270
is that if we&#39;re willing to assume that, in fact, it

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,170
is a good approximation, that the normal approximation holds

24
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,340
for the null distribution, then we don&#39;t need

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,580
to have access to the population data.

26
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,850
So in a realistic situation, where we don&#39;t have access to that data,

27
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,690
we can actually compute a p-value.

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,620
So the t-statistic, central limit theorem,

29
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,080
is telling us the null distribution is approximated by a normal distribution

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,410
with mean 0 and variance 1.

31
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,260
So that means that we can compute p-values by simply computing that.

32
00:01:49,260 --> 00:02:00,140
So the function PNORM, tells us what proportion of normally distributed

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,440
data, which means 0 and standard deviation 1,

34
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,430
are lower than whatever value you put here.

35
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,979
So the p-value would be given to us by that.

36
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,490
Now that&#39;s only bigger.

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,840
So if we want to test bigger in absolute value,

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,760
then we multiply that by 2 because we needed the 2 tails.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,570
And we have ourselves an estimate of a p-value.

40
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:32,430
OK, so now you notice that we did not use the population data at all.

41
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,360
We simply used the sample data at hand.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,980
So now the question that we can ask ourselves

43
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,670
is, how good of an approximation this is.

44
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,980
And here is where we can use the population data to test that.

45
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,190
So we can again act as if we have access to that data.

46
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,340
And we redo this.

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,380
Let&#39;s put n here now.

48
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,900
We redo this.

49
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,455
But now, we divide the nulls by the standard error estimate.

50
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:07,330
 

51
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,270
Let&#39;s put that here.

52
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,360
 

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,340
And that&#39;ll give us the actual null distribution of that t-statistic, which

54
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,510
we&#39;re assuming, using central limit theorem

55
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,940
that it is, in fact, normally distributed.

56
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,670
So we run that.

57
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,042
Wait, we have to do read in the data first.

58
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,560
And the we run the code.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,430
And now we can see how good this distribution is.

60
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,350
We&#39;ll load the rafalib package to make some pictures.

61
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:45,870
So if we make a Q-Q plot against the normal for these nulls,

62
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,580
it should be right on the line.

63
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,740
It should have slope 1 and intercept 0.

64
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,700
So we can check that by,

65
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,870
we just should do a reline 0, 1.

66
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,820
That means make a line with intercept 0 and slope 1.

67
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,650
And it should go right through the data.

68
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,600
And it&#39;s pretty close, telling us that the central limit theorem here

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,420
is, in fact, giving us a pretty good approximation.

70
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:21,320
So the p-value we obtained is a good approximation of the actual p-value.

71
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,790
So now to see when the t-statistic switched around very quickly,

72
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,860
let&#39;s change n to 3 here.

73
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,390
So let&#39;s see what this looks like if I do a simulation now.

74
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,720
But I&#39;m sampling three values instead of 12.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,470
We&#39;re going to see what happens to the null.

76
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,110
We redo the Q-Q norm plots.

77
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:51,402
And we can see that now the data does not follow a normal-- oh, sorry.

78
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:52,360
That&#39;s not quite right.

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,150
We have to change this to 3 as well.

80
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,346
Let&#39;s redo it.

81
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:00,140
It&#39;s not quite that bad.

82
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,920
And now we make these pictures.

83
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,180
And we can see it&#39;s still not very good.

84
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,030
There&#39;s values that are much bigger than what are predicted by the normal.

85
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,890
So in the case of a sample size of 3, the normal approximation

86
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,140
is not good at all with this particular data set.

87
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,730
And it is in this case that we would instead

88
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:32,800
use the t-approximation if, as we explained earlier,

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,090
we believed the original data follows a normal distribution,

90
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,320
then in fact, the t-approximation should work.

91
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,190
OK, so there&#39;s your simulation showing why it

92
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,460
is that we need a bigger sample sizes.

93
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:56,560
And in the next video we&#39;ll show how we actually run the t-test in practice.

94
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,515
