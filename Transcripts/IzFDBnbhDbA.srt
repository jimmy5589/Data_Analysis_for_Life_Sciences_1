SPEAKER: Up to now, we have been focusing on understanding the concepts,

1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,100
and we&#39;ve used population data that we typically don&#39;t have access to.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,890
Here, I&#39;m simply going to show you what you would actually

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,330
do if you had a data set like this.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,880
We can construct a t-statistic, calculate a p-value,

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,740
and confidence intervals.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,020
So the first thing you do in practice is actually reading the data.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,230
This is the data at hand, a 12 and 12.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,820
And now we have to compute the mean difference

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,660
and estimate the standard error.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,410
There&#39;s actually a function in R that does that all for us for us.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,470
It&#39;s called the t-test function.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,450
You can look it up.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,910
You can look up the help file if you want to know the details,

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:49,930
but then you just feed it the two values, the two sets of values

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,250
that you want to compare.

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,150
And you run this.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,870
We can put in an object if you want it, and then we can take a look.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,690
And you&#39;ll see that you get some information here.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,610
You get the t-statistic is 2.0552.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,070
That&#39;s the value we got when we did it by hand.

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,760
The p-value is 0.053.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,400
And then here is a 95% confidence interval.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,270
Now one thing I want you to know is that earlier when

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,550
we used the central limit theorem approximation, the p-value was smaller.

25
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,860
That is because here we are not assuming that the central limit

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,410
theorem applies to the t-statistic.

27
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,250
Instead, we are using the t-distribution approximation.

28
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,580
The t-distribution has bigger tails so you get a smaller p-value.

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,940
Now an assumption we&#39;re making when we use that distribution

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,110
is that the data, the original data, original mouse data,

31
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,890
is normally distributed, meaning that if we had access to the entire population

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,949
and we looked at that, it to be roughly normally distributed.

33
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:19,330
Now we can cast that somewhat by making q-q plots of the sample that we have.

34
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,650
So we can look at the q-q norm of the controls

35
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:31,420
and a q-q norm of the treatment group.

36
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,030
You can see that it&#39;s just 12 points.

37
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,640
So it&#39;s not a perfect check of assumptions,

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,780
but it&#39;s at least telling us that we&#39;re not totally off.

39
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,800
So here it is for the treatment.

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,790
And we&#39;ll then see a similar result. So you

41
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,430
can see that the normal distribution doesn&#39;t

42
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,340
look to be too off, meaning that using the t-distribution approximation

43
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,310
is probably OK.
